Frost penetration in alpine solifluction lobes dependig on relative water content

The aim of this little project is to visualize data from field masurements in a video or a GIF.

A scheme of a solifluction lobe (.png) is colorized depending on measurment values of volumetric water content and temperature below ground.

## Prerequisits
- Python 3.7
- Have the file "Schema Blauberg weiss clean.png" in the working directory
- Have the file "alldata_utf8.csv" also in the working directory
- Install dependencies:
  -  matplotlib
  -  pandas
  -  numpy
  -  Pillow
  -  imageio
  -  opencv-python
## How to use
- definde the timeframe of the data to be visualized
  - possible ...
- there are three scripts
  - ... prepares frames to be packed in a video or gif with the other scripts
  - ... packs the beforehand generated images (.png) to a video
  - ... packs the beforehand generated images to a gif
  
 ## Result
  - you will find a folder with images in the working directory (one image each hour by default)
  - a video file or GIF file will be saved
  
## What can be adjusted
  -
